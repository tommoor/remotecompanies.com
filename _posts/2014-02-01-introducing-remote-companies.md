Remote working is more feasible now than it has ever been, in recent years there has been an explosion of high speed internet, software tools and the kind of knowledge and creative work that can be performed from anywhere.

Employees that have flexible working arrangements are generally happier, healthier and more productive than their office-bound counterparts. So why is telecommuting still such a dirty word, and what can we learn from companies that take this to the limits?

The aim of this website is to collect lessons from distributed teams that work from all corners of the globe and learn from those that are not just making it work, but doing so in a way that is better than most traditional organizations.
